# Song Lyric Analysis Using NLP
This project explores the use of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to analyze and extract insights from song lyrics. The analysis involves preprocessing the lyrics, generating visualizations, and applying advanced NLP methods for a deeper understanding of themes, sentiments, or other linguistic features.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing song lyric data for analysis.
- **Text Analysis**: Applying NLP techniques to explore:
  - Word frequencies
  - Sentiment analysis
  - Topic modeling
- **Visualization**: Using charts and graphs to display results such as word clouds, sentiment distributions, and topic clusters.

### Main Dependencies
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit for text processing.
- **spaCy**: Advanced NLP library for efficient text parsing.
- **matplotlib/seaborn**: Visualization libraries.
- **pandas/numpy**: Data manipulation tools.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Import or scrape song lyrics for analysis.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Remove stop words, special characters, and perform stemming/lemmatization.
3. **Exploratory Analysis**: Generate word clouds, frequency histograms, and other exploratory visualizations.
4. **Advanced Analysis**: Perform sentiment analysis, topic modeling, or other NLP techniques to extract meaningful patterns.
5. **Visualization**: Summarize findings in easily interpretable visual formats.

## Results
- Insights into recurring themes in song lyrics.
- Sentiment trends in songs from different genres or artists.
- Topic clusters identifying common lyrical subjects.

## Future Improvements
- Adding genre-based comparisons.
- Expanding the dataset to include a wider range of artists and languages.
- Incorporating deep learning models for more nuanced lyric analysis.
